‚ùå Hiring developers to build automation tools: $30,000 + 6 months
‚úÖ Buying my complete automation platform: $5,000 + 2 days setup

I built a full-stack automation SaaS platform that's production-ready and generating-capable.

3 ways buyers are using it:
1. White-label to agency clients ($5K-25K per license)
2. Offer as monthly service ($1K-5K/month per client)
3. Launch as subscription SaaS ($5K-20K/month recurring)

Tech stack: React 18, Node.js, MongoDB, Python
What's included: Everything. Source code, docs, support.

This is a real business opportunity for 1/6th the development cost.

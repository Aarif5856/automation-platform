## 🎬 RECORDING TIPS

### Before You Start:
- [ ] Close unnecessary tabs (only show demo)
- [ ] Turn off notifications (silence phone/computer)
- [ ] Test your audio (do 10-second test first)
- [ ] Have script nearby (but don't read it robotically)
- [ ] Breathe and relax!

### While Recording:
- [ ] Speak clearly and not too fast
- [ ] Pause between sections (can edit later)
- [ ] If you mess up, just pause and start that section again
- [ ] Move mouse slowly (fast movement looks bad on video)
- [ ] Don't worry about being perfect - genuine > polished

### After Recording:
- [ ] Watch it once
- [ ] If major issues, re-record
- [ ] If minor issues, it's fine - ship it!
- [ ] Upload to YouTube (can be unlisted)
- [ ] Add title: "Complete Automation SaaS Platform Demo - For Sale on Flippa"

- Looks suspicious
- Buyers unsure if it's real

**Your listing WITH video:**
- Expected bid increase: $500-$2,000
- Builds massive trust
- Shows it's real and working

**1 hour to make video = $1,000-$3,000 extra in final sale price**

**HUGE ROI!**

## 📞 STUCK?

**Problem:** "I'm nervous on camera"
**Solution:** Don't show your face! Screen-only recording is fine.

**Problem:** "I don't sound good"
**Solution:** Buyers don't care. They want to see it works.

**Problem:** "I mess up while recording"
**Solution:** Pause, breathe, start that section again. Edit it out later.

**Problem:** "I don't have time"
**Solution:** Do the 2-minute version. Seriously better than nothing!

**Problem:** "What if people steal my code?"
**Solution:** Don't show code. Just show the UI working. That's enough!

---

## 🎉 YOU GOT THIS!

**Remember:**
- Perfect is the enemy of done
- A "bad" video is better than no video
- Buyers want to see it works, not Hollywood production
- You'll get better final price
- This is the #1 thing missing from your listing

**STOP READING. START RECORDING. RIGHT NOW! 🎬**

**After you finish:** Add the YouTube link prominently in your Flippa listing and tweet about it!

**Good luck! 🚀**

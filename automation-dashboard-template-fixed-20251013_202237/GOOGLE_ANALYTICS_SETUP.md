# Google Analytics 4 Setup Guide

## 🎯 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

This website is pre-configured with Google Analytics 4 (GA4) tracking. You just need to add your tracking ID.

### Step 1: Create Your Google Analytics Account

1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Click "Start measuring" or "Add Property"
3. Enter your website name (e.g., "Automation Solutions Business")
4. Select your timezone and currency
5. Click "Create" and accept the terms of service

### Step 2: Set Up a Data Stream

1. Select "Web" as your platform
2. Enter your website URL
3. Name your stream (e.g., "Main Website")
4. Click "Create stream"
5. **Copy your Measurement ID** (looks like `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)

### Step 3: Add Your Tracking ID to the Website

**Option A: Update index.html (Recommended)**

Open `client/public/index.html` and replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Measurement ID in **two places**:

```html
<!-- Line 33 -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>

<!-- Line 38 -->
gtag('config', 'YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID', {
```

**Option B: Use Environment Variable**

Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory:

```bash
REACT_APP_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID
```

The analytics system will automatically use this value.

### Step 4: Rebuild and Deploy

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

Upload the new `build` folder to your hosting provider.

### Step 5: Verify Tracking

1. Visit your website
2. In Google Analytics, go to **Reports** → **Realtime**
3. You should see yourself as an active user within 30 seconds
4. Open developer console (F12) - you should see "📊 Analytics initialized"

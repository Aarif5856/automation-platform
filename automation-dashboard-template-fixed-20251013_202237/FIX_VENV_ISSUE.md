# ðŸ”§ Fix: Virtual Environment Package Issue

## The Problem

You're in a virtual environment `(.venv)` where Python packages aren't installed.
The packages are in your global Python installation but not in the venv.

---

## âœ… SOLUTION 1: Use Global Python (Easiest)

### Deactivate the Virtual Environment:

```powershell
deactivate
```

Then run your scripts normally:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\USER\Desktop\automation
python demo-automation-tools.py
```

Or:
```powershell
cd automation-templates
python linkedin-lead-generator.py
```

**This is the easiest solution** - all packages are already in your global Python!

---

## âœ… SOLUTION 2: Install Packages in Virtual Environment

If you want to keep using the virtual environment:

### Step 1: Make sure you're in the venv
```powershell
cd C:\Users\USER\Desktop\automation
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### Step 2: Install all packages
```powershell
python -m pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 requests pandas email-validator lxml openpyxl webdriver-manager python-dotenv xlsxwriter schedule APScheduler
```

### Step 3: Run your scripts
```powershell
python demo-automation-tools.py
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDED: Just Deactivate the venv

Since all your packages are already in global Python:

1. **Type:** `deactivate`
2. **Press Enter**
3. **Run your scripts normally**

You should see your prompt change from:
```
(.venv) PS C:\Users\USER\Desktop\automation>
```

To:
```
PS C:\Users\USER\Desktop\automation>
```

Then everything will work!

---

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Test After Deactivating

```powershell
# Deactivate venv
deactivate

# Test the demo tools
python demo-automation-tools.py

# Test individual tools
cd automation-templates
python linkedin-lead-generator.py
python web-scraper.py
python email-campaign-manager.py
```

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Happened

- Virtual environments isolate Python packages
- Your venv is empty (no packages installed)
- Your global Python has all packages
- Solution: Either use global Python or install packages in venv

**I recommend: Just use global Python** (deactivate the venv)

---

## âœ… Commands to Copy-Paste

### Deactivate venv and run demo:
```powershell
deactivate
cd C:\Users\USER\Desktop\automation
python demo-automation-tools.py
```

### Test all tools:
```powershell
deactivate
cd C:\Users\USER\Desktop\automation\automation-templates
python linkedin-lead-generator.py
```

---

## ðŸš€ You're Ready!

Just type `deactivate` and press Enter, then run your scripts!

All packages are already installed in your global Python. âœ…

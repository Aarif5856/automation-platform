## ‚úÖ DO THESE 3 THINGS TODAY (2-3 Hours)

### Priority 1: Fix Your Flippa Listing (1 hour)

**Open:** `URGENT_FLIPPA_ACTIONS.md`
**Do:**
- [ ] Update listing title (copy from file)
- [ ] Replace description (use improved template)
- [ ] Add demo URL prominently
- [ ] Lower reserve price to $2,500-$3,000 (more realistic)
- [ ] Add "Buy It Now" at $6,500
- [ ] Add 5+ screenshots from demo site

**Why:** Your listing determines if people bid. Fix this first!

---

### Priority 2: Create Demo Video (1-2 hours)

**Open:** `SIMPLE_DEMO_VIDEO_SCRIPT.md`
**Do:**
- [ ] Go to Loom.com (free, easy)
- [ ] Record 5-minute demo following script
- [ ] Upload to YouTube
- [ ] Add link to Flippa listing

**Why:** Listings with video get 3-5x more bids. This ONE action could add $1K-$3K to final price!

---

### Priority 3: Drive Traffic (30 minutes)

**Open:** `COPY_PASTE_SOCIAL_POSTS.md`
**Do:**
- [ ] Post on LinkedIn (copy-paste template)
- [ ] Email 5-10 agencies (template provided)
- [ ] Post on Reddit r/SideProject
- [ ] Share in Facebook groups

**Why:** More eyeballs = more bids = higher final price

## üìä EXPECTED RESULTS

### If You Do Nothing:

- Need to relist

### If You Follow This Plan:
- Expected bid: $2,000-$4,000
- 70-80% success rate
- Net profit: $1,500-$3,500 after fees
- Complete in 10-15 hours of work

## üí∞ PRICING RECOMMENDATION

**Current Situation:**
- Reserve at $5,000 is too high for current bid level ($100)
- With 9 days left, buyers see it as "unreachable"

**Recommended Change:**
- ‚úÖ Lower reserve to $2,500-$3,000
- ‚úÖ Add "Buy It Now" at $6,500
- ‚úÖ This makes it feel achievable
- ‚úÖ Still profitable for you ($2K+ after fees)

**Why This Works:**

## üé¨ DEMO VIDEO IS CRITICAL
